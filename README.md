# parallel_programming
Happy parallelizing from the TUM CSE Parallel Programming course, SS 2016 :)

Here you can find, mainly, my short presentation "Repast Computing Model" and my solutions for the tutorial exercises.

I have all these here because I like sharing knowledge. If you found my material helpful, I invite you to also share yours! :-)

I am quite fascinated with parallel programming as of now.


Also, if you find any bug or you have a suggestion, I would be glad to hear!


A TIP: 
It is very easy to introduce a bug in parallel programming. Unfortunately, if you have already introduced one such bug it will be very difficult to detect errors in parallel applications because of their non-deterministic behaviour. Sometimes even if an error is detected, it is often difficult to reproduce it. It is very difficult to cover the whole parallel code behaviour with only one kind of testing. Even if one testing method informs that there are no errors, you can't be sure about it. Using only one of the approaches to testing parallel applications is inefficient. That's why it would be wise to use combination of testing methods such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, formal verification and, torture testing or possibly multiple testing tools, all of them.
